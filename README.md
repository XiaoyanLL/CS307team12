Creating games is a process many people want to get involved with, but it's often difficult to find an engine that both suits the creator’s needs and doesn’t have a steep learning curve. Parchment recognizes these issues and provides an intuitive GUI that allows users to seamlessly edit various facets of their game and build their own 2D Zelda-like experience from the ground up, offering users a map editor, sprite editor, item editor, support for user code, a robust file system, and various other features to assist in the game making process. By streamlining the game development process, Parchment eliminates the large time investment it takes for new users to become acquainted with utilizing a new engine and equips them with the necessary resources to create their own 2D bird’s eye view game with little to no prior experience.
